    <h2>I Am Akhiljith</h2>
    <p>
      I am a passionate artist and developer who enjoys blending creativity with technology.
      Art allows me to express emotions, ideas, and stories, while development helps me turn
      ideas into functional and engaging digital experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      From visual artworks to interactive websites, I focus on creating work that feels
      meaningful, simple, and visually appealing.
    </p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>
      My journey began with simple sketches and curiosity about design. Over time, this
      curiosity evolved into a strong interest in digital art, web design, and creative coding.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have worked on various projects including art portfolios, web applications,
      payment integrations, and interactive user experiences — each one shaping my skills
      both creatively and technically.
    </p>

    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>
      I believe art and technology together can create powerful experiences.
      My goal is to keep learning, experimenting, and pushing my creative boundaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through my work, I hope to inspire others, collaborate with creative minds,
      and leave a lasting impression through thoughtful design and innovation.
